# Stream Beaver Helm Chart

Stream Beaver is a project that provides an API for consuming MQTT messages and storing them in MongoDB, with endpoints to retrieve the data. It includes a FastAPI application for handling HTTP requests and a Node.js script (`mqtt-to-mongodb.js`) for subscribing to MQTT messages and inserting them into MongoDB.
